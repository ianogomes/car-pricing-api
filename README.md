## Description

This is an API that allows users to get an estimate for how much their car is worth based on make/model/year/mileage, or to report what they sold their vehicles for. Besides, the API also handles sign up and sign in with email/password, and gives Admins the power to approve reported sales.

The purpose of building the API is just practicing my knowledge on NestJS with a somewhat complex application, which includes database, authentication and automated testing.
